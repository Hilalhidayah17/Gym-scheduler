            Itâ€™s important to start with a light weight that you can comfortably
            control with proper form. As you get comfortable with the exercise,
            you can gradually increase the weight
          </li>
          <li>
            Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, and keep your back
            straight and your shoulders relaxed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing your body. Your
            arms should be straight down at your sides.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slowly lift your shoulders straight up towards your ears as high as
            possible, keeping your arms straight. Make sure to use your scapula
            and traps to lift the weight, not your biceps or your neck.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hold the top position for a moment, making sure to contract your
            traps fully.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slowly lower the dumbbells back down to the starting position,
            keeping your arms straight.
          </li>
        </ul>
